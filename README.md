## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to change the styles depending on the size of the device thats accesing the page.

```css
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  div {
    width: 22.5%;
  }
}
```

I had problems understanding how block/inline/inline-block elements work, but also how to center them using width, margin and text-align.


### Continued development

In future projects I want to imporve my skills in CSS to try out different methods like grid, flexbox or float. I am still not comfortable with how to handle inline/block elements, which is something I can further develop
